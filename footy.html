                    This excerpt features a conversation with photographer Peter Sutherland, known for his work
                    capturing subcultures and urban life. We discuss his early photography projects, including a 2004
                    publication focused on graffiti and street art figures, as well as a film highlighting New York
                    City's bike messenger community in the early 2000s. The conversation also touches on his experiences
                    living in New York, transitioning to life outside the city, becoming a parent, and how these shifts
                    have influenced his creative perspective.
